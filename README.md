# Webcomic-Theme
Html + css source code for the theme of the [Hikki Of The Valley Webcomic](https://hikkiofthevalley.tumblr.com/)


For a variety of reasons (unfamilarity with Tumblr as a site, being unable to dig up info on Theme Anorak, as well as simply wanting to hand this out to the OMORI community) I have open sourced my recreation of the Tumblr theme of the original Omoriboy webcomic by OMOCAT


If anyone would like to comment on how I can write things better, or has any info that I missed please let me know!

## Todo

- Figure out how to export the accent color
- Add CSS / structure for other post types (although I'm not sure for these specific purposes any post beyond NPF / Legacy Text is necessary )
- Figure out more things to do






- Remove Hikki's sentience
